# PaylocityEmployeeBenefitsPackage


Business Need: One of the critical functions that we provide for our clients is the ability to pay for their employees’ benefits packages. A portion of these costs are deducted from their paycheck, and we handle that deduction. Please demonstrate how you would code the following scenario: 
1. The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee 
2. Each dependent (children and possibly spouses) incurs a cost of $500/year 
3. Anyone whose name starts with ‘A’ gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent

We’d like to see this calculation used in a web application where employers input employees and their dependents, and get a preview of the costs. This is of course a contrived example. We want to know how you would implement the application structure and calculations and get a brief preview of how you work. 
Please implement a web application based on these assumptions: 
1. All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions 
2. There are 26 paychecks in a year

User Story 1: As an Employer, I should be able to add Employees and their dependents.

User Story 2: As an Employer, I should be able to see a preview of the costs. All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions. There are 26 paychecks in a year.

User Story 3: As an Employer, I should be able to see a preview of the costs after deductions. The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee. Each dependent (children and possibly spouses) incurs a cost of $500/year. Anyone whose name starts with ‘A’ gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent
